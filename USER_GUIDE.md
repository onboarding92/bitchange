**How to Enable 2FA:**

3. If you lose your phone, these codes are the ONLY way to access your account
4. Click **I've Saved My Backup Codes**

**✅ 2FA is now enabled!** You'll need to enter a code from Google Authenticator every time you log in.

### Using Backup Codes

If you lose access to your Google Authenticator app:

1. Go to the login page
2. Enter your email and password
3. Click **Use Backup Code** instead of entering a 2FA code

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Security**
2. Click **Set Anti-Phishing Code**

## Staking

### What is Staking?

Staking allows you to earn passive income by locking your cryptocurrency for a fixed period. Your staked assets earn rewards based on the Annual Percentage Rate (APR).

**How It Works:**
1. Choose a staking plan (asset, APR, lock period)
2. Stake your cryptocurrency
3. Earn rewards daily
4. Unstake after the lock period ends (or anytime for flexible staking)

### Available Staking Plans

**Example Plans:**

| Asset | APR | Lock Period | Min. Amount |
|-------|-----|-------------|-------------|
| BTC | 5% | 30 days | 0.01 BTC |
| ETH | 6% | 60 days | 0.1 ETH |
| USDT | 8% | Flexible | 100 USDT |
| BNB | 7% | 90 days | 1 BNB |

**Note:** Actual plans and rates may vary. Check the Staking page for current offers.

### How to Stake

**Step 1: Go to Staking Page**
- Navigate to **Staking** from the main menu

**Step 2: Choose a Staking Plan**
- Review available plans
- Compare APR, lock period, and minimum amounts
- Click **Stake** on your chosen plan

**Step 3: Enter Stake Amount**
- Enter the amount you want to stake
- Must be at least the minimum amount
- Check your available balance

**Step 4: Review Details**
- **Amount:** Your stake amount
- **APR:** Annual percentage rate
- **Lock Period:** How long funds are locked
- **Maturity Date:** When you can unstake
- **Estimated Rewards:** Approximate rewards at maturity

**Step 5: Confirm Staking**
- Click **Confirm Stake**
- Your funds will be moved from available balance to locked balance

**✅ Staking Active!** Your position is now earning rewards.

### How to Unstake

**For Locked Staking:**
- You can only unstake after the maturity date
- Navigate to **Staking** → **My Positions**
- Click **Unstake** on the matured position
- Rewards are calculated and added to your balance
- Principal + rewards are returned to your available balance

**For Flexible Staking:**
- You can unstake anytime
- Navigate to **Staking** → **My Positions**
- Click **Unstake** on any active position
- Rewards are calculated based on days staked
- Principal + rewards are returned to your available balance

### Staking Rewards Calculation

**Formula:**
```
Rewards = (Principal × APR × Days Staked) / 365 / 100
```

**Example:**
- You stake 1 BTC at 5% APR for 30 days
- Rewards = (1 × 5 × 30) / 365 / 100
- Rewards = 0.00410958 BTC

### Staking Tips

1. **Diversify** - Don't stake all your funds in one asset
2. **Consider liquidity** - Only stake funds you don't need immediately
3. **Compare rates** - Higher APR often means higher risk
4. **Start with flexible** - Try flexible staking first to understand the process
5. **Compound rewards** - Restake your rewards to earn more

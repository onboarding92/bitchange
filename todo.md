## 🎯 RECENT FIXES - December 17, 2025

### ✅ Fix 1: Authentication Context - COMPLETED
**Problem**: OAuth session was overriding email/password login
**Solution**: Modified `server/_core/context.ts` to check `auth_token` cookie first
**Result**: Both OAuth and email/password authentication now work correctly
**Tested**: Successfully logged in as trader1@test.com

### ✅ Fix 2: Trading UI - COMPLETED  
**Problem**: Orders weren't being placed when clicking Buy/Sell buttons
**Solution**: Fixed after auth context update (was authentication issue)
**Result**: Orders are now placed successfully and visible in order book
**Tested**: Placed sell order BTC/USDT @ 86000, visible in database and UI

### ✅ Debug Logging Added - COMPLETED
**Added**: Comprehensive logging to `placeOrder()` and `matchOrder()` functions
**Location**: `server/tradingEngine.ts` lines 143, 156, 182-184, 186, 196-252
**Purpose**: Debug matching engine behavior

### ⚠️ Logout Button - PARTIALLY WORKING
**Status**: Button exists but dropdown doesn't open
**Location**: `client/src/components/DashboardLayout.tsx` lines 211-238
**Issue**: DropdownMenu component not opening on click
**Workaround**: Clear cookies via browser console
**Priority**: P2 - Minor UI bug

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUE - Matching Engine

### Status: DEBUG IN PROGRESS

**Problem**: Orders placed but not matched automatically

**Evidence**:
- Sell order: BTC/USDT @ 86000, 0.3 BTC (trader1) ✅ SUCCESS
- Buy order: BTC/USDT @ 86000, 0.3 BTC (buyer2) ❌ FAILED SILENTLY
- No `[PLACE_ORDER]` or `[MATCHING]` logs when clicking "Buy BTC"
- Buy order never reaches backend

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. ✅ Debug logging added to both functions
2. ✅ Verified `matchOrder()` is called at line 183
3. ❌ Buy order mutation fails on frontend before reaching backend
4. ❌ Likely cause: Insufficient balance (buyer2 has 43k USDT locked, only 7k available)
5. ❌ Trying to buy 0.3 BTC @ 86000 = 25,800 USDT (exceeds 7k available)
6. ❌ No error toast shown to user

**Next Steps**:
1. 🔴 Add error toast in `Trade.tsx` for failed mutations
2. 🔴 Check browser console for tRPC errors
3. 🔴 Clear locked balances: `UPDATE wallets SET locked = 0`
4. 🔴 Test with sufficient available balance
5. 🔴 Add balance validation UI (show available vs required)

**Workaround**:
```sql
-- Clear locked balances for testing
UPDATE wallets SET locked = 0 WHERE userId IN (
  SELECT id FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%test%'
);
```

**Documentation**: See KNOWN_ISSUES.md section 3 for full details
